# Poker II Mappings

The  Poker II has to be hand-programmed, but at least I can document what my
mappings are, to make future changes easier to plot.

[Here's the manual](https://adprice.fedorapeople.org/poker2_manual.pdf).

## Media Keys

For the media keys, there's a 30ms pause defined between `Ctrl+Alt` and the 
final character. Without it, Gnome will sometimes miss the keybinding.

`Pn+P`
:   `Ctrl+Alt+P`, defined on my machines as play/pause

`Pn+[`
:   `Ctrl+Alt+[`, defined on my machines as prev song

`Pn+]`
:   `Ctrl+Alt+]`, defined on my machines as prev song

## Window management

`Pn+W/A/S/D`
:   `Super+Up/Left/Down/Right`, used by Gnome for maximizing and snapping
    windows

`Pn+Fn+W/A/S/D`
:   `Ctrl+Alt+Up/Left/Down/Right`, used by Gnome for maximizing and snapping
    windows
